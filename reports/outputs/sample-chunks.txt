To enable meaningful applications in the early stages of fault-tolerant quantum computing, devising methods to suppress post-correction logical failures is becoming in- creasingly crucial

. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the application of zero-noise extrapolation, a practical quantum error mitigation technique, to error correction circuits on state-of-the-art superconducting processors. By amplifying the noise on physical qubits, the cir- cuits yield outcomes that exhibit a predictable dependence on noise strength, following a polynomial function determined by the code distance. This property enables the effective application of poly- nomial extrapolation to mitigate logical errors. Our experiments demonstrate a universal reduction in logical errors across various quantum circuits, including fault-tolerant circuits of repetition and surface codes. We observe a favorable performance in multi-round error correction circuits, indi- cating that this method remains effective when the circuit depth increases

.991 on Processor I within 0.5μs, as demonstrated in our repetition code experiment by al- lowing repetitive measurements on the syndrome qubits up toM = 4 rounds (see next). As the first experimental demonstration, we show that ZNE works on an example circuit with a feedback X control to eliminate the bit-flip error onQ0 (Fig. 2a), where the nominal data qubits (Qj for j = 0, 2, and 4) are each initialized into a superposition state given by |ψj⟩ = cos θj 2 |0⟩ −i sin θj 2 |1⟩. The first 4 CNOT gates in the sequence diagram are used to encode the parity of the data qubits onto the syndrome qubits (Q1 and Q3), followed by operations for algorithmic purpose, and the next 4 CNOT gates serve to decode and identify the bit-flip type of errors that may occur during the opera- tional stage. To implement ZNE, one needs to be able to controllably amplify the errors, which can be achieved using schemes such as pulse stretching [25, 28] or subcir- cuit repetition [29]
