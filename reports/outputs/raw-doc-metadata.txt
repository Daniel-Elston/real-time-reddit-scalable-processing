egrating error mitigation tech-
niques with error correction, this study demonstrates a
practical pathway to bridge the gap between the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era and the fault-
tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era, advancing the
pursuit of practical quantum computing technologies.
II. RESULTS
We shall first justify the application of ZNE to quan-
tum error correction circuits. The essential assumption
made in ZNE is that the expected value of an observ-
able is a function ⟨O⟩(r) of the noise strength r, and
this function can be fitted well by simple functions such
as polynomials. This assumption holds in NISQ circuits,
which has been illustrated in many theoretical works and
experiments [3, 6, 7, 12, 23–25]. In this paper

The circuit of a repetition code, schematically depicted
in Fig. 3b, consists ofd data qubits andd − 1 syndrome
qubits arranged alternately in a linear chain. The data
qubits are initialized in the state|0⟩, preparing the logical
qubit in the logical state|0L⟩. Next, we apply error injec-
tions and perform parity-check measurements forM suc-
cessive rounds. The circuit terminates with an additional
round of error injection and transversal measurement on

final round of parity checks and readout of the logical
operator ZL. The parity checks are designed to detect
all possible bit-flip errors, whether in

after, applications of quantum mechanics in the field of
information science is the use of entanglement distribution
to communicate quantum information effectively.
Similar to the continued improvements of functional
quantum computers over the past decade, advances in
demonstrations of entanglement distribution over long
distances may enable new applications in aeronautics and
space communications. The existing NASA Quantum
Communications Analysis Suite (NQCAS) software
models such applications, but limited experimental data

There are two main categories of QKD: prepare-and-
measure, and entanglement-based (quantum teleportation)
[16]. The former was the first proposed method of QKD,
and although very practical and influential, it’s description is
outside of the scope of this paper [10]. Within the realm
of entanglement-based QKD, there have been a number of
proposed protocols that use different algorithms to generate
a secret encryption key. The most common of these protocols
was developed by Artur Ekert in 1991, and it is aptly named
E91 [17].

tively, andPk,m(ai,bj) represents the probability
of measuring Alice’s bit as k and Bob’s bit as m given the
measurement bases Ai and Bj. Given the set of bases used by
Alice and Bob, it can be quickly derived that the ideal S value
for perfect entanglement known as Tsirelson’s Bound [20] is
S = −2
√
2, (4)
while the ideal S value for classical transmission is
S = −2. (5)
For these full derivations, see Section V .
With these idealisms, we form the standard CHSH Bell
Inequality as
|S| ≤2, (6)
where a violation of this inequality points to a violation of
local realism, indicating an acceptable entangled state.
When Eve measures the photon in a random basis, the
state collapses accordingly. Then, when Eve attempts to
retransmit this photon, t

modeled by two characteristics: a single bit, and the basis that
Alice measures it in.
After the Alice basis and bit generation, the measurement
of the state is modeled using either one or two Bell State
collapses, dependent on whether or not that transmission has
been intercepted by Eve (a constant probability per pump).
The state collapse process is informed by the E91 and CHSH
papers [17], [19], where they define Eqs. (1) to (3). The scalar
product of Alice’s and Bob’s basis unit vectors are used to
compute the theoretical same-bit probability. Subsequently,
the bit measurements are determined for whoever is making
said measurement.

This whole process repeats until the desired key length
multiplied by the excess bit factor bits are achieved in the
same-basis measurements. Then, the simulated elapsed time is
calculated as entangled photon pairs / pump rate. Finally, the
different basis measurements are used in the CHSH inequality
test to calculate S, as described in Section I. The raw data from
the simulation is then returned to ‘BitGeneration’, where the
desired statistics are calculated and subsequently returned to
the ‘QKDmodel’ function.

The second function called by ‘QKDmodel’ (named
‘InformationReconciliation’) takes as its input each of the

 This indicates that the current quantum state collapse
implementation is reasonable for the Eve case as well.
The 4 data points for this scenario that violate the
classical limit indicate scenarios when Alice and Bob would
attribute their measurement disruptions to high noise and
not Eve. These scenarios become increasingly unlikely as
the key length increases, which will be needed for complete
NQCAS verification testing. Additionally, the high second
pair generation rate of 1/3 per first pair does not degrade the
link as much as one may expect. These topics are addressed in
Section IV .

In the future, there are a number of different steps that
may be taken to increase the utility of the work described.
First, adjusting the implementation of the model such that
it considers different types of source lasers and different
environmental noise sources, allowing the model to output
data that more closely reflects the experimental data. Next,
vectorizing the MATLAB scripts to optimize efficiency, as
opposed to the current iterative method, to reduce runtime.
Additionally, running more simulations with varying input

C. Same-Bit Probability
Recall Eq. (3) from Section I. The probabilities in this
equation can be split into 2 categories: one where Alice and
Bob have the same bit measurement, and one where they do
not. For any given basis combination, let P= be the sum of the
former category and let Px be the sum of the latter such that
P= = P0,0 +P1,1
Px = P1,0 +P0,1.
According to Eqs. (2) and (3), this means that the
theoretical correlation coefficient E, in terms of the theoretical
collapse probabilities, is given by
E(ai,bj) =−ai ·bj = P= −Px.
When this equation is combined with the normalization
condition of
P= +Px = 1,
it can then be used to solve for the ideal probability for same-
bit measure in terms of the th

egrating error mitigation tech-
niques with error correction, this study demonstrates a
practical pathway to bridge the gap between the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era and the fault-
tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era, advancing the
pursuit of practical quantum computing technologies.
II. RESULTS
We shall first justify the application of ZNE to quan-
tum error correction circuits. The essential assumption
made in ZNE is that the expected value of an observ-
able is a function ⟨O⟩(r) of the noise strength r, and
this function can be fitted well by simple functions such
as polynomials. This assumption holds in NISQ circuits,
which has been illustrated in many theoretical works and
experiments [3, 6, 7, 12, 23–25]. In this paper

There are two main categories of QKD: prepare-and-
measure, and entanglement-based (quantum teleportation)
[16]. The former was the first proposed method of QKD,
and although very practical and influential, it’s description is
outside of the scope of this paper [10]. Within the realm
of entanglement-based QKD, there have been a number of
proposed protocols that use different algorithms to generate
a secret encryption key. The most common of these protocols
was developed by Artur Ekert in 1991, and it is aptly named
E91 [17].

Alice measures it in.
After the Alice basis and bit generation, the measurement
of the state is modeled using either one or two Bell State
collapses, dependent on whether or not that transmission has
been intercepted by Eve (a constant probability per pump).
The state collapse process is informed by the E91 and CHSH
papers [17], [19], where they define Eqs. (1) to (3). The scalar
product of Alice’s and Bob’s basis unit vectors are used to
compute the theoretical same-bit probability. Subsequently,
the bit measurements are determined for whoever is making
said measurement.

This whole process repeats until the desired key length
multiplied by the excess bit factor bits are achieved in the
same-basis measurements. Then, the simulated elapsed time is
calculated as entangled photon pairs / pump rate. Finally, the
different basis measurements are used in the CHSH inequality
test to calculate S, as described in Section I. The raw data from
the simulation is then returned to ‘BitGeneration’, where the
desired statistics are calculated and subsequently returned to
the ‘QKDmodel’ function.

 This indicates that the current quantum state collapse
implementation is reasonable for the Eve case as well.
The 4 data points for this scenario that violate the
classical limit indicate scenarios when Alice and Bob would
attribute their measurement disruptions to high noise and
not Eve. These scenarios become increasingly unlikely as
the key length increases, which will be needed for complete
NQCAS verification testing. Additionally, the high second
pair generation rate of 1/3 per first pair does not degrade the
link as much as one may expect. These topics are addressed in
Section IV .

C. Same-Bit Probability
Recall Eq. (3) from Section I. The probabilities in this
equation can be split into 2 categories: one where Alice and
Bob have the same bit measurement, and one where they do
not. For any given basis combination, let P= be the sum of the
former category and let Px be the sum of the latter such that
P= = P0,0 +P1,1
Px = P1,0 +P0,1.
According to Eqs. (2) and (3), this means that the
theoretical correlation coefficient E, in terms of the theoretical
collapse probabilities, is given by
E(ai,bj) =−ai ·bj = P= −Px.
When this equation is combined with the normalization
condition of
P= +Px = 1,
it can then be used to solve for the ideal probability for same-
